            </h1>
        <div>
            <p id="description">I was born in Saigon Vietnam on March 31st of 2006. While I was born in a busy city I tend to keep to myself often spending my times on a computer browsing various pages on the internet. Beside the computer I also spend a large majorty of my childhood playing badminton, the sport that taught me the importance of discipline. After a few years, me and family moved to Oxnard, California where I would live for next few years. After living in Oxnard for a few years I moved to Anaheim where I am currently living in and that's where I started to go into robotic and computer science. Now I am current attending Anaheim High School as a Senior. </p>
